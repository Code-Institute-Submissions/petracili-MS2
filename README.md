### <u>Scope of the project</u>

 Nowadays, when people don't care so much about health and movement because of their way of life, and when because of today's technologies, they sit in offices
 in a range of physical guilt. The idea of the EliteFitGym concept was born, which will be available to everyone
 with various individual and group training. We offer you the opportunity to train 0-24 7 days a week. Our team of coaches is at your disposal to help.
